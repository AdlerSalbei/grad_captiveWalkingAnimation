Gruppe Adler Captive Walking (short: GRAD Captive Walking) adds a walking animation to the ACE captive state.
The animations only work on Players, becouse AI reacts weirdly.

Features:
- Animation for ACE Captive state
- Breaking ties by rubbing them on trees

Dependencies:
- CBA
- ACE

This project is also hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/gruppe-adler/grad_captiveWalking
Feel free to report issues and submit pull requests there.
There will be no non ACE version.
